 <h1 align="center"> Oyku's Project: Web-based extension to the existing Bilkent Erasmus Application </h1>
 
## Description
Oyku's Project is a web-based extension to the existing Bilkent Erasmus Application that intends to enhance the usage of the application by moving all of the paperwork and communication done outside of the scope of the application to the digital grounds, which is inside of the scope of the current Bilkent Erasmus Application with an user-friendly user interface. 
 
## Aim
The aim of this project is to enhance the usage of Bilkent Erasmus Application by the current users and potential users that are neglected of the applicaton due to current undigitized means of processing tasks that are related to Erasmus and exchange programs. We intend to improve the standards of carrying out tasks related to Erasmus and other exchange programs by digitizing the remaining undigitized paperwork and means of communication and support the current program by providing high-level features that serve the aim that is mentioned above.
 
## Summary of the High-Level Features That Will Be Provided
* Paper and email usage is minimised as much as possible by transporting the procedures to digital based platform.
* Students are able to see their Erasmus and paperwork status with color indicators.
* To-do list is available for Erasmus and exchange coordinators with user-friendly user interface to improve their means of tracking their tasks related to Erasmus and other exchange coordinators. If any matter related to Erasmus needs the attention of the coordinators, the matter that needs to be handled is viewed as a task in a to-do list and coordinators will be notified of their tasks. Coordinators will not need to check their emails and other platforms to check the status of students and other matters and maintain their work schedule with only this to-do list. 
* Workload of departments coordinators can be distributed with coordinators choice and it can be customized at any time by the coordinators. 
* All comunications related with Erasmus and other exchange programs will be done through the extension's messaging platform.
